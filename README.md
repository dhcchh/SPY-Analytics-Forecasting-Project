# Investment Analytics: Highlighting the Value of Stock Market Investments for Long-Term Growth

### **Introduction**

This project explores the power and potential of investing in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), one of the most widely held and traded ETFs that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index. By analyzing historical returns, evaluating its effectiveness as a hedge against inflation, and applying machine learning models to predict its future price, the project offers a comprehensive view of SPY's investment potential in different market conditions.

The project is structured into three distinct parts:

1. **Historical Returns Analysis**: 
   We dive into the historical performance of SPY, showcasing the power of long-term investing by analyzing its returns over various time periods. This section highlights the benefits of holding SPY as a foundational asset for portfolio growth.

2. **Hedge Against Inflation**: 
   In this section, we evaluate SPY's ability to act as a hedge against inflation. With rising concerns about inflation in today's economic landscape, we explore how SPY performs during inflationary periods and whether it provides protection for investors' purchasing power.

3. **Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**: 
   The final part of the project leverages machine learning models to forecast SPY's future price. This section combines time-series modeling with advanced machine learning techniques to offer insights into the future trajectory of SPY.

This repository contains the code and models used in the project to demonstrate the power of investing in SPY, its role as a hedge, and its potential future outlook.

## Part 1.1 
[Part 1 Analysis](https://chan-dinghao.notion.site/Part-1-1-Yielding-Significant-Returns-10120b01262d4acf88637f0bc6bd3c03?pvs=4)
### Key Insights Derived:
- Consider only nominal ROI.  
- You will not save enough to comfortably retire solely relying on interest rates from saving accounts.
- The investor does not need any investing knowledge, they just need to open a brokerage account and purchase SPY.
- The investor must be patient. They may not see returns in the short runs, but they will definitely see  returns in the long run.
- In my opinion, the investor must contribute US$1000 monthly in order to see significant returns.
